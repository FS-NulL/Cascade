-- Content Information -------------------------------------------------------------------

   This texture set is provided as-is, for free, for use in custom maps for Quake4, Doom3,
DarkPlaces, or whatever other engine they happen to look good in.  Created at the end of 
2006 to try something that wasn't entirely made of metal, for what eventually became 
Strombine. Mostly featureless materials, but lots of decals for seams/ridges/stains.  You 
are perfectly welcome to redistribute them with your map or mod release, as long as I get 
to see Lunaran in the credits and feel good about myself.
